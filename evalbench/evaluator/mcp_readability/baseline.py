"""Where the previous run's readability judgement is read back from.

A baseline is the most recent daily judgement for an endpoint, reconstructed
from the identity columns a run already writes. It exists so a caller can
compare this run's fingerprints against the previous one's.

There are three stores. NullBaselineStore is the default and never finds one,
so every run is a full judge, exactly as today. LocalResultsBaselineStore scans
results/*/evals.csv, bounded by max_runs because that directory grows without
limit. BigQueryBaselineStore queries the shared results table; it is the repo's
first BigQuery read path and reuses the project and dataset resolution that
reporting.bqstore uses for writes.

Two rules hold for all of them. Stores prime once and are then read from
memory, because _check_endpoint runs in a thread pool and a per-endpoint query
would be N round trips and racy against the store. And failure degrades rather
than aborts: a store error is logged and treated as "no baseline", costing a
re-judge and nothing else. That is a deliberate exception to the orchestrator's
fail-fast handling, since a baseline is an optimisation rather than a
measurement, and the identity writing results may have no read permission on
the dataset.
